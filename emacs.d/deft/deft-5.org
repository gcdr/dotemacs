Neural Network

* Symmetrically Connected Networks

  There are just like the recurrent neural networks, but the
  connections between units are symmetrical, i.e., they have same
  weight in both directions.

  Symmectrically connected neural networks without hidden units are
  called "Hopfield nets"

* Recurrent NN

  recurrent neural network has the ability to remember the information
  in the hidden layer for quite a long time.  But currently we don't
  have a very efficient method to train it.

  IIya Sutskever's recurrent neural network could generate pretty good
  English sentences after fed with English Wikipedia billions of times.
