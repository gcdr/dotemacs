* how to read papers

This is a summary of the paper, *How to Read a Paper* by *S. Keshav*,
from *David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science, University of
Waterloo*.  Author's email is *keshav@uwaterloo.ca*.

** Three-Pass approach

*** The first pass

:Goal: Get a general idea of the paper your are reading.

:Time: 5-10 minutes.

:Steps: Usually it follows:

1. title, abstraction and introduction
2. section and sub-section headings
3. conclusion
4. references

:Postcondition: At the end of the first pass, following questions
should be *clear*:

1. Category.  Measurement paper? Analysis of existing system?
   Research prototype?
2. Context. Other paper it relates to.  Theoretical bases.
3. Correctness.  Assumptions and conclusions.
4. Contributions.
5. Clarity.  Is it well written?

*** The second pass

:Goal: Get a detailed view of the paper *except the proofs*.

:Time: About an hour.

:Steps: Usually it follows:

1. Look carefully at the figures, diagrams and other
   illustrations. Graph details, say axes lables, relationships with
   the conclusions and etc separate shoddy work from excellent.
2. mark relevant unread references.

:Postcondition: At the end of the second pass, the following questions
should be *clear*:

1. Main content of the paper.
2. you should be able to *summarize the main thrust of the paper with
   supporting evidence* to someone else.

*NOTE*: /this level of detail is appropriate for a paper in which you
are interested but does not lie in your research speciality./

*** The third pass

:Goal: To fully understand a paper.

:Time: 4-5 hours for beginners, about an hour for the experienced.

:Steps: As follows:

1. Virtually reimplement the paper.
2. Compare your vitual work with the paper to get insight of its
   proof techniques.

:Postcondition: Following things *may* be clear:

1. Ideas for future work.
2. Be able to reconstruct the paper entirely from memory.
3. Strength and weakness.
